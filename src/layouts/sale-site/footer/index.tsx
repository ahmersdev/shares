          It is solely your responsibility to determine whether any investment,
          strategy, or transaction aligns with your personal financial
          objectives, circumstances, and risk tolerance. We strongly encourage

          All investments carry risks, including potential partial or total
          loss. By accessing this site, investors acknowledge and understand
          that investing in real estate involves risks, the real estate market
          may fluctuate, and properties may not meet performance expectations.
          Future property values are uncertain, and there may be a risk of loss
          in value. Investors should carefully review all available information
          and consult their tax and legal advisors before investing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Transactions on the Wyoming DAO Marketplace are executed using USD
          Coin (USDC), a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, via smart
          contracts on the blockchain. If a non-USDC payment method is used, it
          will be converted to USDC at the prevailing rate. In the event of
          order cancellations or expirations, any unspent USDC will be returned
          to your Wyoming DAO Wallet. If you submit a sell order and it is
          fulfilled, you will be paid in USDC, which can be converted to USD
          through third-party cryptocurrency exchanges.
